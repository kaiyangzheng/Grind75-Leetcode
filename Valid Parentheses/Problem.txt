Valid Parentheses
=================

Given a string s containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.

An input string is valid if:

Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
 

Example 1:

Input: s = "()"
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: s = "()[]{}"
Output: true
Example 3:

Input: s = "(]"
Output: false

Solution 
========
1. Optimal

use a stack data structure
iterate through string
if the character is not a close tag, append it to the end of the stack
if the character is a close tag, check if the last character of the stack is the corresopnding open tag
if it isn't, return False, as there needs to be corresponding tags
if it is, pop the stack (remove from the end of the stack)
